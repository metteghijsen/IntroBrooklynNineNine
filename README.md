# Intro Brooklyn Nine-Nine

## Project description
I made this project as a result of a school assignment. The assignment was to recreate an intro or outro in a web page. Since I like Brooklyn Nine-Nine, I decided to recreate its intro. 

When you open the project, a screen comes up where you can fill in the names of all the characters. This allows you to create your own Brooklyn Nine-Nine intro.
When you press the play button, the intro will play in your browser.
